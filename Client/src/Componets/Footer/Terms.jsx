We want to make women more beautiful, by offering a huge range of Ethnic Indian wear that only we can give. Biba is an idea that goes beyond just what you see. The word BIBA in Punjabi is an endearment for a young and pretty girl implying sublime qualities, so it was the name decided by Mrs. Meena Bindra, the founder of BIBA for her line of Salwar, Kameez and Dupattas started in 1986. It was a line which was fashionable – which is what BIBA stands for – and affordable. New ranges were added with time and BIBA started a very stylish Mix-n-Match range which was added as a second category. The Mix-n-Match in BIBA is very contemporary in feel and look, while our Salwar Kameez are very ethnic with focus on Indian crafted look, hand block prints and vegetable dyes, Indian handlooms with traditional embroideries and other Indian techniques' and sensibilities applied in the making of the garment. All with the goal of providing you with a truly unique ethnic, wow-inspiring experience.</p>
